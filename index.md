> **What is the Live Music Archive all about?**
>
> This audio archive is an online public library of live recordings available
> for royalty-free, no-cost public downloads. We only host material by
> trade-friendly artists: those who like the idea of noncommercial distribution
> of some or all of their live material. Live recordings are a part of our
> culture and might be lost in 100 years if they're not archived. We think music
> matters and want to preserve it for future generations.
