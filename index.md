*Car Wars Simulator* is an unofficial "game aid" for the sixth edition of Steve Jackson Games' Car Wars (6e).

- BUILD your next car by searching for cards and EDIT with confidence knowing you can easily undo changes.
- SAVE builds before your next game night or SHARE ideas with others.
- RUN a Monte Carlo SIMULATION against another build to compare results from hundreds or thousands of games!
